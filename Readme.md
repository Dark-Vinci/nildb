### This is my attempt to build a mini distributed SQL database systems with Golang, The features the finished database will have includes the following,

- Partitioning
- Sharding
- Replication (Master, Slave configuration)
- UI

#### I am working on this project because I want to have a full graps of database internals from BTrees, Indexes, Distributed systems, Query Optimization...

For my learning, I use the CMU Database group youtube video and also MIT distributed systems course.

*** I will make significant updates to this readme file as time goes on***
